## Lessons Learned

1. **Start with spec docs**: Having SPECIFICATION.md prevents scope creep
2. **Type safety matters**: TypeScript catches many bugs early
3. **shadcn/ui is great**: Copy-paste approach is flexible and fast
4. **React Query simplifies**: Less state management code
5. **RLS is powerful**: Database-level security is elegant
6. **AI features delight**: Voice input and receipt scanning are loved
7. **Theme from day one**: Easier to implement early than retrofit

## Next Steps (After Phase 5)

1. **User Testing**: Get feedback from 10-20 beta users
2. **Iterate**: Fix bugs, improve UX based on feedback
3. **Marketing**: Create landing page, social media presence
4. **Content**: Write blog posts about features
5. **Community**: Build Discord or forum for users
6. **Monetization**: Consider premium features (if demand exists)
